        <h3>
            1. Material: polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
        </h3>
   
        The material of a PVC braided hose consists of two main components:<br>
         polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and a braided polyester yarn reinforcement.<br>
<ul>
    <li>
   <h4>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC):</h4> 
   PVC is a synthetic plastic material that is known for its durability, flexibility, and resistance to chemicals and
    UV radiation.It forms the core of the hose, providing the main conduit for the transfer of liquids or gases.
</li>
<li>
<h4>Polyester Yarn Reinforcement: </h4>
The braided polyester yarn is wrapped around the PVC core, providing additional strength and support to the hose. 
This reinforcement helps to prevent the hose from collapsing or kinking under pressure, making it suitable for high-pressure applications.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Application: Versatile Application </h3>
Some Common Application are <br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>GARDENING AND WATERING:</h4>PVC braided hoses are often used for watering plants and gardens, 
        as they can handle high-pressure water flow and are resistant to wear and tear.</li>
    <li><h4>AUTOMOTIVE AND RACING FUEL SYSTEM : </h4> Nylon braided hoses are suitable for carrying gas, oil, diesel,<BR>
         and other fluids in automotive and racing applications. They are designed to withstand high temperatures and resist chafing.<BR>
    </li>
    <li><h4>INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION: </h4> Nylon braided hoses are suitable for carrying gas, oil, diesel, and other fluids <BR>
        in automotive and racing applications. They are designed to withstand high temperatures and resist chafing.<BR>
    </li>   
</ol>

<h3>3. Purpose: TO PROVIDE HIGH PERFORM AND RESISTANT HOSE FOR VARIOUS  APPLICATION  </h3>
PVC BRAIDED HOSE VARIOUS ADVANTAGE SUCH AS 

<ol>
    <li><h4>Enhanced durability:</h4>  The braided nylon outer layer provides increased strength and resistance to abrasion,<br>
         making the hose less likely to be damaged or punctured.</li>
    <li><h4>Excellent  Heat dissipation</h4>The PVC  braided hose can better dissipate heat, which is crucial in high-performance <br>
        applications where heat buildup can be a concern.</li>
    <li><h4>Better flow</h4>The braided structure allows for a smoother flow of fluids, such as fuel or oil, through the hose, improving <BR>
        overall performance.</li>
</ol>
