            1. Material:  Polyvinyl Chloride
        </h3>
        The material of PVC Green Suction Hose is Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC). It is typically made of extruded soft plastic,<BR>
         often reinforced with a rigid helix, providing flexibility and good abrasion resistance.<BR>

<h3>2. APPLICATION :It Has various applications  </h3>
Some of them are: <Br>
<OL>
<li>Water Supply in Agriculture and Irrigation.</li>
<li>Water Supply in Agriculture and Irrigation.</li>
<li>Suction of Sewage disposal, Saline Solution, Light acids, and other chemicals (except solvents).</li>
<li>Chemical applications.</li>
<li>Water Irrigation.</li>
<li>Construction, water transfer, agricultural, and industrial applications.</li>
</OL>

<h3>3. Purpose:Facilitate the transfer of fluids in various applications</h3>

Theased on the provided information, the purpose of a PVC green suction hose is to facilitate the transfer of <br>
fluids in various applications. These hoses are strong, lightweight, and flexible, making them suitable for construction,<br>
 water transfer, agricultural, and industrial uses. The smooth bore PVC construction minimizes friction loss, allowing for<br> 
 full production flow. Additionally, PVC suction hoses are flexible and have good abrasion resistance due to their extruded<br>
  soft plastic construction reinforced with a rigid helix. They are commonly used with water pumps, trash pumps, and centrifugal<br>
   water pumps in construction sites and other settings.<Br>
