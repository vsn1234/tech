            1. Material: RESISTANT TO CORROSION
        </h3>
   
        The material of quick release couplings can vary depending on the specific standard<br>
        or manufacturer. Common materials used in quick release couplings include<br>
<ul>
    <li>
  Stainless steel (AISI 316)
</li>
<li>
    Carbon steel (EN-10277-3)
</li>
<li>
    Brass (DIN-EN 12164)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Application: Versatile Application </h3>
Some Common Application are <br>
<ol>
    <li>
 <h4>HYDRAULIC SYSTEM</h4>Quick release couplings are used in hydraulic systems for equipment maintenance or operation systems. They are designed<br> according to different standards, such as ISO 7241-A, ISO 7241-B, Gromelle 6000, Hansen W6000, and Parker 60, which are subjected to<BR>
  different industry applications.</li>

    <li>
 <h4>TRANSPORATION: </h4> Quick release couplings are used for quick connection and disconnection of trailers with trucks through air brake lines,<BR>
        They are also widely used in coupling and decoupling rail carriages. Airplanes and ships use quick release couplings extensively.
    </li>
    <li><h4>INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION: </h4> Nylon braided hoses are suitable for carrying gas, oil, diesel, and other fluids <BR>
        in automotive and racing applications. They are designed to withstand high temperatures and resist chafing.<BR>
    </li>   
</ol>

<h3>3. Purpose:   </h3>
QUCIK RELEASE COUPLING HAS VARIOUS PURPOSE SUCH AS 

<ol>
    <li>Quick and easy connection or disconnection of fluid lines in hydraulic and pneumatic systems.
        To prevent fluid leakage during connection or disconnection.</li>

        <li>Facilitate equipment maintenance, operation, and fluid transfer without the need for tools.</li>
        <li>Applicable in various industries, including mining, construction, hydraulic jacks, and high-pressure fluid transfer systems.</li>
        <li>Designed for severe conditions where hydraulic shocks, system vibrations, or hose bending are possible.</li>
</ol>
