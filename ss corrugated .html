        <h3>
            1. Material:Stainless Steel
        </h3>
   
        The stainless steel grades commonly used in corrugated hoses include 304, 304L, 321, 316L, and 316Ti. <br>
        These hoses are known for their flexibility, durability, and ability to handle various types of fluids,<br>
        gases, or materials in different applications.<br>

<h3>2. APPLICATION : Industrial, commercial, and domestic applications </h3>
Some Common Application are <br>
<ol>
    <li>
 <h4>IRON & STEEL MANUFACTRING</h4>

 These hoses are used in the transportation of molten metals, slag, and other materials in steel plants.</li>

    <li>
 <h4>Oil and Gas industry: </h4> 
 SS corrugated hoses are used for handling oil, gas, and other petrochemical products in refineries and other facilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>AUTO COMPANIES: </h4>
        SS corrugated hoses are used in the automotive industry for various applications, including exhaust systems and fluid transfer.
    </li>   
</ol>

<h3>3. Purpose:   </h3>
QUCIK RELEASE COUPLING HAS VARIOUS PURPOSE SUCH AS 
The primary purpose of SS (Stainless Steel) corrugated hose is to provide a flexible and durable conduit for the transfer of <BR>
various substances, such as gases, fluids, and steam, in industries like gas, chemical, and steam. The corrugated design allows <Br>
for flexibility while maintaining pressure tightness, and the stainless steel construction ensures resistance to corrosion and <br>
high temperatures. Additionally, the external layer of stainless steel wire braid provides extra strength and prevents axial elongation <br>
when pressure is applied.<br>
