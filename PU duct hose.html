            1. Material: POLYURATHANE
        </h3>
   
        The material of PU Duct Hose is polyurethane (PU). This flexible ducting is often used for industrial air movement, <br>
        fume control, and dust collection applications. The polyurethane wall and spring steel wire helix reinforcement provide<br>
         excellent compressibility, abrasion resistance, and chemical resistance. The thinner wall allows for a high compression rate,<Br>
          lower weight per meter, and great flexibility<br>

<h3>2. APPLICATION : SERVAL APPLICATIONS LIKE:  </h3>
PU duct hoses, made of flexible polyurethane (PU), have several applications due to their lightweight, durable, and flexible nature.<br>
 They are commonly used for light-duty air, dust, and material transportation and extraction. Some specific applications include: <br>
<ol>
    <li>
 <h4>Landfill venting:</h4>

PU duct hoses help control odors and methane gas emissions from landfills. </li>

    <li>
 <h4>Ultraviolet (UV) dryers:</h4> 
 PU duct hoses are utilized in UV dryers for air circulation and drying purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Pharmaceutical work:  </h4>
        These hoses are employed in pharmaceutical facilities for air filtration and dust extraction.
    </li>   
</ol>
Additionally, PU duct hoses are resistant to chemicals, moisture, wear, and tearing, making them suitable for various other applications.


<h3>3. Purpose:  TRANSPORT MATERIALS </h3>

The purpose of a PU (Polyurethane) duct hose is to transport materials such as shavings, chips, granules, pellets, dry foodstuff, and<BR>
 pharmaceutical preparations. PU duct hoses are lightweight, wear-resistant, flexible, and resistant to oils, solvents, and gas fumes. <br>
 They are often used in applications like lawn and leaf collection, dust control, and light bulk material handling. PU duct hoses are <br>
 suitable for various industries due to their ability to resist abrasion, tearing, punctures, degradation by hydrolysis and microbes, <br>
 and their wide temperature range (-40 to 200 degrees F). They are also crush-resistant, clear for viewing inside, and have a smooth <Br>
 interior to ensure efficient airflow and prevent material build-up.
