            1. MATERIAL: PVC (polyvinyl chloride)
        </h3>
   
        The material of LPG hoses, also known as PVC gas hoses or propane hoses, is typically high-quality PVC (polyvinyl chloride). <br>
        These hoses are specifically designed to withstand the unique properties and requirements of LPG. They are engineered to be flexible,<br>
         durable, and resistant to abrasion, impact, and exposure to various weather conditions. The perforated cover of an LPG hose is resistant <BR>
         to mild chemicals, oil, and ozone.<br>

<h3>2. Application: Versatile Fixation</h3>

The application of LPG hoses primarily involves the safe and efficient transfer of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), such as propane and butane,
 from one container to another. They are commonly used in various settings, including:
<ol>
<li>Delivery hoses for oxygen lines in welding equipment.</li>
<li>Transfer of LPG in home burner systems, grills, and other appliances.</li>
<li>Conveyance of liquid gas in oil-resistant applications. </li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Purpose:  Transfers liquid petroleum gases</h3>

Based on the provided information, the purpose of an LPG hose is to transfer liquid petroleum gases, such as propane, in commercial<br>
 and industrial applications. These hoses are designed for delivery, supply, and transfer of propane and are available in various <br>
 materials to cater to different industrial markets, including chemical, dairy, petroleum, marine, foodservice, and others. They are used<br>
  in bulk material handling and transfer applications.<Br>
