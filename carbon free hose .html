        <h3>
            1. Material: Smooth White Synthetic Rubber Tube
        </h3>
        The material of Carbon Free Hose primarily consists of:
<ol>
       <li> Tube: Smooth White Synthetic Rubber Tube, which is non-conductive.</li>
        <li>Reinforcement: High Tensile Synthetic Plies.</li>

    </ol>
        These components are designed to provide resistance to heat,<BR>
         ageing, abrasion, and ozone. The Carbon Free Hose is also available in different specifications<BR>
          to cater to various piping needs.<BR>

<h3>2. APPLICATION :Transportation of power cables  </h3>

The application of Carbon Free Hose primarily involves carrying power cables in industries where exposure to high temperatures,<br>
 current leakage, radiation, open flames, and hot metal splashes are common. These industries include glass works, electrical <br>
 furnaces, and iron & steel industries. The hose acts as a protective barrier for the cables, ensuring their safe operation <br>
 under harsh conditions. Additionally, Carbon Free Hose is used in conveying furnace coolant and carrying power cables in steel<br>
  mills and the glass industry, where non-conductive applications are required.<br>

<h3>3. Purpose: Covering wires and cables in electrical and electronic devices</h3>
The Carbon Free Hose is a type of rubber hose designed for covering wires and cables in electrical and electronic devices.<BR>
 It is specifically engineered to provide high flexibility and lightweight properties. These hoses are manufactured using,<Br>
  high-grade raw materials, ensuring durability and reliability in various applications. The purpose of the Carbon Free <br>
  Hose can be summarized as follows:<br>

  <ol>
    <li><h4>INSULATION </h4>
        The Carbon Free Hose is used to insulate and protect electrical wires and cables from external factors, <BR>
        such as heat, moisture, and physical damage.<br>
    </li>
    <li><h4>FLEXIBLITY</h4>
        Flexibility: The high flexibility of the Carbon Free Hose allows for easy installation and routing<BR>
         of wires and cables, even in confined spaces.<BR>
    </li>
    <li><h4>TEMPERTAURE RESISTANCE</h4>
        The Carbon Free Hose can withstand a wide range of temperatures, typically from -10 to 150 degrees Celsius, <br>
        making it suitable for various industrial and commercial applications.<Br>
    </li>
