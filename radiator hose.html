            1. Material: SNTHETIC RUBBER 
        </h3>
   
        The material used for car radiator hoses is typically synthetic rubber, often containing fibers for added strength.<br>
         The inner and outer layers of the hose are made of EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) rubber, while the reinforcing<br> 
         layer consists of polyester or aramid fibers. This combination provides high temperature and high pressure resistance,<br>
         making it suitable for the demanding environment of a car’s cooling system.<br>

<h3>2. APPLICATION : USED IN ENGINES OF VEHICLES  </h3>
The application of a radiator hose is to transport engine coolant, also known as antifreeze, between the engine and the radiator.<br>
 This helps maintain the engine’s optimal operating temperature by transferring heat away from the engine and dissipating it through <br>
 the radiator. The radiator hoses, typically made of rubber, are designed to withstand high temperatures and pressures within the engine<br>
  cooling system. They ensure the continuous circulation of coolant, preventing the engine from overheating and sustaining damage.<br>
   In most vehicles, there are two primary radiator hoses: the upper hose, which carries hot coolant from the engine to the radiator,<br>
    and the lower hose, which returns the cooled coolant back to the engine. Regular inspection and maintenance of radiator hoses are <br>
    essential to ensure their integrity and prevent potential engine damage due to overheating.<br>

<h3>3. Purpose:  TRANSPORT ENGINE COOLANT</h3>

The primary purpose of a radiator hose is to transport engine coolant, also known as antifreeze, between the engine and the radiator.<BR> 
This helps maintain the engine’s optimal operating temperature by circulating the coolant, which absorbs excess heat from the engine<BR>
 and releases it through the radiator. Radiator hoses also contribute to the overall functionality of the cooling system, ensuring that<BR>
  the engine does not overheat and sustain damage. Regular inspection and maintenance of radiator hoses are essential to ensure their <BR>
  integrity and prevent potential issues.<BR>
