        <h3>
            1. Material: STAINLESS STEEL 
        </h3>
        The material of SS flexible hoses is stainless steel (SS). These hoses are manufactured from special<br>
         stainless steel sheet strips, with common types being 304/304L and 316/316L, as per TSE and EN ISO European standards.<br> 
         They are also lightweight, highly resistant, extremely flexible, and have a wide operating temperature range, from -200°C to +800°C.<br>
         Stainless steel hoses have a high melting point, making them resistant to fire and suitable for various applications.<br>

<h3>2. Application: Industrial applications</h3>
Following are the application of SS FLEXIBLE HOSE  <br>
<ol>
    <li>
        SS flexible hoses are widely used in various industrial applications due to their flexibility, high strength, and resistance to corrosion.
</li>

    <li>
They are particularly suitable for applications where high temperatures and harsh operating conditions are prevalent.
    </li>

    <li>SS flexible hoses are used in combis and cookers in houses, meters at the entrances of flats, fountains, armatures, 
        and decorative indoor gas installations.
    </li>   
    <li>They find application in food processing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Purpose:   </h3>
The purpose of a flexible hose is to carry gases and fluids, such as chemicals, water, steam, and air, from one location to another. <br>
They are designed to be practical and can be used for various applications across different industries. Flexible hoses offer several <br>
advantages over rigid pipes and tubing, such as being simple to route, withstanding vibration, and accommodating thermal expansion or<br>
 contraction. This makes them suitable for situations where there is movement of one end of the conductor while the opposite end is fixed,<br>
  or when the system needs to handle vibrations or temperature changes.<br>
