        <h3>
            1. Material: STAINLESS STEEL
        </h3>
   
        The material of SS (Stainless Steel) bellow is typically austenitic stainless steel, which is an iron-based alloy containing<br>
        chromium and nickel. The most commonly used grades of stainless steel for metal bellows and expansion joints are SS304/304L, SS316/316L,<br>
         and SS321. These materials offer a good combination of strength, corrosion resistance, and cost-effectiveness. Stainless steel bellows<br>
          can withstand high temperatures and pressures, making them suitable for various applications. The specific material properties, such as<br>
           density and coefficient of thermal expansion<br>

<h3>2. Application:VERSATILE APPLICATION</h3>
Based on the provided context, SS Bellows, also known as Stainless Steel Bellows, are used in various applications due to their <br>
flexibility, corrosion resistance, and ability to handle pressure and temperature changes. Some of their applications include:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Pneumatic connections</li>
    <li>Gas water heaters</li> 
    <li>Gas stoves</li>
    <li>Meters</li>
    <li>Vacuum chambers</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. Purpose: Used in piping system</h3>
Stainless steel bellows are used in pipe lines and ducts where high temperature and pressure are present. They are<br>
 designed to accommodate or absorb the thermal movements of the ducts or pipes due to high temperature and pressure.<br>

 They are used widely in PIPING SYSTEM because of the following reasons :

 <ol>
    <li><h4>Flexibility and Compensation:</h4>
        Stainless steel bellows act as flexible pressure-resistant pipes in liquid or gas conveying systems. <Br>
        They compensate for the connection of pipes, machines, and equipment, allowing for movement and vibration<BR>
         without compromising the integrity of the system.<br>
        </li>
    <li><h4>Pressure Resistance:</h4>
        Stainless steel bellows can withstand high pressure, making them suitable for use in piping systems that handle <br>
        high-pressure fluids or gases.<br>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Corrosion Resistance:</h4>
        Stainless steel bellows provide good corrosion protection due to their chromium and nickel content,<br> 
        making them suitable for use in corrosive environments.<br>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Temperature Resistance:</h4>
        Stainless steel bellows can withstand high temperatures, making them suitable for use in piping systems that handle hot fluids or gases.
    </li>
    <li><h4>Connection Methods</h4>
        Stainless steel bellows can be connected using various methods, including flange connection, welding,<br>
        threaded connection, and quick joint connection. This versatility allows for easy integration into different piping systems.<br>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Efficient Design:</h4>
        The use of stainless steel bellows can reduce the number of elbows, wires, and pipe clamps required in a system, resulting in a<BR>
         more efficient and streamlined design.<br>
    </li>
